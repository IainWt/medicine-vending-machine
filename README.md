# Medicine Vending Machine

I am unable to make the full project publicly available, so I have only uploaded the main file.

This project uses the OpenAI API to enhance medicine vending machines by:
- providing translations into any language
- explaining any pharmaceutical products
- creating images of any pharmaceutical products

When the stock of any products in the vending machine get too low, it will also automatically send an email to the person in charge of restocking.
